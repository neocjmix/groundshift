# Railway viewer deployment

**Live:** [Independent 120-view reconstruction](https://groundshift-viewer-production.up.railway.app/?world=/worlds/independent/world.json) · [Original supplied-pose dozer](https://groundshift-viewer-production.up.railway.app/?world=/worlds/reconstructed/world.json) · [Houseplant](https://groundshift-viewer-production.up.railway.app/)

The user explicitly requested Railway hosting after local M0/M1 acceptance. Only the static viewer and selected licensed examples are hosted. Reconstruction, camera estimation, training, original input and job logs remain on the local Mac. The hosted viewer can open a private world folder directly in the browser, without uploading it.

`deploy/Dockerfile.github` downloads the locally built archive, checks its SHA-256, and copies only `www/` into the pinned official Caddy image. Runtime notices, world provenance, camera metadata and dataset licenses are included. Large assets are release attachments, not Git commits. Root `.dockerignore` excludes everything except the deployment files.

The source is pinned to the listed commit. Pushing documentation or application changes alone does **not** update this deployment. For a new viewer version, build and validate a fresh local package, publish it under a new release tag, update the URL/checksum in `deploy/Dockerfile.github`, push that commit, then reconnect the Railway service to that exact commit. Retain the previous release for rollback.

The previous [viewer-2026-11-04 release](https://github.com/neocjmix/groundshift/releases/tag/viewer-2026-11-04)
and source `81adf61858673dedf9367196f4430ba8c5f24b16` remain available for rollback.
Its deployment was `00a9186e-8ae1-48b4-8371-a30072c65015`; archive
`groundshift-viewer-8c806e7.tar.gz`, SHA-256

## Revisit release verification

The new release adds camera-path navigation and the separately identified
[120-photo independent reconstruction](INDEPENDENT_RECONSTRUCTION.md). The
original Dozer PLY is unchanged; only its camera sequence metadata was added.
All 40 original camera matrices are unchanged. The smaller 24-view pipeline
experiment was not selected for publication because of its poor visual quality.

**PASS:** Railway build checksum, container health, all 18 public file hashes,
real 404s for missing/private paths, actual rendering of all three scenes, and
the new scene's play/pause, keyboard view selection and free look. Free look
changed camera rotation while preserving position. Actual public rendering is
shown in the [inspected screenshot](evidence/railway-independent-120.jpg).

The new scene displayed 75,397 Gaussians, 6.94 MB, 2.53 s load/decode and a
60 fps rolling label in the in-app Chromium browser on M2 Metal. This is one
observation with no native training active, not a controlled cold-cache or
GPU-only benchmark. The public file's SHA-256 matches the local native export:
`67f64ebeea5fc8cdae8ea65f01e0f4d060291d120bb5656311cad6bdd0b67229`.
Raw evidence: `data/validation/deployment/railway-revisit-{http,browser,logs}.json`.

Preparation passed TypeScript, lint, 118 viewer unit tests, 41 Python tests,
production build and four headed Chrome tests. Native image pipeline and
Metal training have separate execution reports; original walking-video
acceptance is still NOT RUN.

## Prepare a curated package locally

```sh
npm ci
npm run sample
npm run package:viewer
```

To include the already reconstructed, licensed dozer result:

```sh
npm run package:viewer -- --include-reconstruction
```

To include the separately verified independent sample as well:

```sh
npm run package:viewer -- --include-reconstruction --include-independent
```

`--include-independent` requires the measured world copied into
`public/worlds/independent/`. Both generated scene directories are ignored by
Git. This flag selects that one explicit licensed artifact, not arbitrary
folders under `public/worlds/`.

The option requires `public/worlds/reconstructed/` from the local M1 run. The default includes only Houseplant. The command builds locally and prints a fresh staging directory under `data/deploy/viewer-<timestamp>/`. It copies only HTML, hashed bundles, icon, runtime notices, explicitly selected manifests/assets/camera metadata and dataset credits. It excludes source datasets, native tools, private footage and job logs. A SHA-256 inventory stays beside the staging directory, outside any upload.

The staging directory contains `Dockerfile`, `Caddyfile`, `.dockerignore` and `www/`. To prepare the release attachment, substitute the exact printed path and a fresh archive name:

```sh
COPYFILE_DISABLE=1 tar -czf data/deploy/groundshift-viewer-<revision>.tar.gz \
  -C data/deploy/viewer-<timestamp> www
shasum -a 256 data/deploy/groundshift-viewer-<revision>.tar.gz
```

Compare the archive contents against the staging inventory before publishing. The current release includes `SHA256SUMS` and `viewer-files.json` as independently readable checksums. Re-download the published archive and verify the checksum before connecting Railway.

## Railway configuration

The Railway connector created the project/service, configured it, and attached `neocjmix/groundshift` at the pinned commit. The local Railway CLI token and saved login were expired; this did not block the connector. GitHub CLI authentication was valid, so a GitHub release supplied the curated files without requiring another login.

Apply these settings through the Railway connector or service settings:

- Dockerfile path: `deploy/Dockerfile.github`; repository root as build context.
- Healthcheck: `/healthz`, timeout 60 seconds.
- Restart: `ON_FAILURE`, maximum 3 retries.
- Public domain target: port 8080. Caddy listens on Railway's `PORT` (default 8080), on all interfaces.
- No custom start/build command, volume, database, bucket, secret or GPU service is required.

Railway rejected configuring a `railway.json` path for this new service. Its current [Infrastructure as Code documentation](https://docs.railway.com/infrastructure-as-code) says Config as Code is deprecated, unavailable to new services, and stops being read for legacy services on 2026-12-01. The unused JSON configuration was removed; this one service uses direct settings without adding an IaC dependency.

Railway terminates HTTPS. Missing manifests/assets return genuine HTTP 404s. Hashed bundles use immutable caching; HTML, manifests and scene paths revalidate. Use **Open world folder** for private local artifacts. Loading arbitrary localhost HTTP URLs from an HTTPS website is subject to browser mixed-content, CORS and local-network restrictions.

### Alternative: authenticated CLI upload

This path is available for a future session with valid CLI authentication. Set the service's Dockerfile path to `Dockerfile` before uploading the curated directory, keeping the healthcheck/restart/domain settings above:

```sh
railway up data/deploy/viewer-<timestamp> --path-as-root --no-gitignore \
  --project db649cd6-49db-4750-b86d-c3c4d14b213d \
  --environment production --service 2c6ac4d5-37bb-4ea8-aee0-1e75a1abdf69
```

`--no-gitignore` is only appropriate with the curated staging directory and `--path-as-root`. Never apply it to the repository root. The current deployment used the connector/GitHub route, not this CLI upload.

## Initial public verification — 2026-11-04

| Check | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Railway container build/start/health | PASS | Build log verifies archive checksum, starts Caddy and passes `/healthz`; deployment SUCCESS |
| HTTPS and static file integrity | PASS | All 14 decoded public files match the local SHA-256 inventory; root and health return 200 |
| Licenses, manifests, cache headers | PASS | JSON parses; credits/notices reachable; immutable hashed bundles and no-cache world/HTML responses |
| Missing/private paths | PASS | Missing JSON/PLY, `/.env`, `/data/jobs/dozer-1500/job.json` return 404 |
| Houseplant actual rendering | PASS | Leaves and pot visible in [public-origin screenshot](evidence/railway-houseplant.jpg) |
| Local dozer actual rendering | PASS | Excavator, road and cones visible in [public-origin screenshot](evidence/railway-dozer.jpg); direct deep link also verified |
| Orbit, zoom, reset, scene replacement | PASS | Actual camera-position changes and return to initial coordinates; one canvas after replacement |
| Browser errors | PASS | No errors in captured browser console |
| Railway CLI upload | NOT RUN | Invalid local authentication; deployment used the connected Railway plugin |
| Other devices and load/stress testing | NOT RUN | No cross-device or capacity claim |

Public-browser checks used the Codex in-app Chromium browser on this M2 Mac, 1280 × 720 CSS viewport. Runtime reported `ANGLE (Apple, ANGLE Metal Renderer: Apple M2, Unspecified Version)`. Observed rolling frame-rate labels were 60 fps for both scenes. Load + decode displayed 2.54 seconds for Houseplant and 5.14 seconds for dozer; these are single observations, not controlled cold-cache benchmarks. Browser/edge caches were not forcibly cleared, and dozer loaded after Houseplant. These measurements are separate from the original localhost Chrome results.

Raw HTTP hashes, browser details/camera positions and Railway build/runtime logs are retained locally in `data/validation/deployment/railway-{http,browser,logs}.json`. Earlier local Caddy validation remains in `local.json`. TypeScript, lint, 86 unit tests and the production build passed during package preparation; the subsequent packaging-only adjustment passed syntax and inventory checks, with unchanged `www/` hashes.

The Docker image is pinned to the verified available `2.11.7-alpine` manifest digest; Caddy's current release was 2.11.8 when checked, but that Docker tag was not yet available.
